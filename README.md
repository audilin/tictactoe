## Inspiration
Tic-Tac-Toe, but more fun :)

## What it does
play tic tac toe by entering the row and column.

## How we built it
C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio, using an array to create the "board", and inputs to decide what is on the board.

## Challenges we ran into
checking the board to see if anyone has won yet

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
the choice to choose a special character to put on the board

## What we learned
that it can be challenging to implement special features

## What's next for Tic-Tac-Toe
doing it in a more interactive language, like JS
